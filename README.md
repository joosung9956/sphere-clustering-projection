# Three Simple Algorithms for Clustering and Visualizing High-Dimensional Point Clouds

This repository contains Python implementations for the algorithms described in the arXiv note:

[arXiv link will be here after announcement]

## Algorithms

- **Algorithm 1**: Fixed-radius sphere-based clustering
- **Algorithm 2**: Adaptive radius clustering for varying densities
- **Algorithm 3**: Incremental projection plane adjustment for visualization

## Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
